## Welcome to my GitHub Journal 

This journal is there to help me remembering how I got there in the end (minus the dead ends).

### Get started

I started with the [hello world tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) to understand what this is all about.

### Get the desktop app for github

Next I installed the [github desktop app](https://desktop.github.com) to be able to sync a folder on my computer, which is much easier than editing online.

### Create a website

Next, I created a website using the [hugo academic template](https://themes.gohugo.io//theme/academic/post/getting-started/). I realised in doing so that installing the desktop version of git.

### Create a book

Next, I created a guidebook for my module, following [this tutorial](http://seankross.com/2016/11/17/How-to-Start-a-Bookdown-Book.html) and these steps:

1. Fork https://github.com/seankross/bookdown-start
2. Rename the repository
3. Clone the repository to your desktop
4. Fetch origin in GitHub Desktop
5. Open R Studio and create a new project, select the cloned directory of the GitHub repository
6. Open _output.yml; change the book title and the split_by: section 

      Note: the split_by option is best for a short document so the whole text can be saved in the index.Rmd file.

7. Open _bookdown.yml and change the book_filename, and the repo:
8. Open index.Rmd and make the required changes.
